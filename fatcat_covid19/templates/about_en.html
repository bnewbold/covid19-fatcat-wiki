<h1>About Fatcat COVID-19 Paper Search</h1>

<p>
This is a prototype full text search index of papers, reports, datasets, and
other research resources related to the COVID-19 crisis, including public
health responses to influenza pandemics more generally. The curation of content
to be included is based on efforts like the "CORD-19" dataset and efforts by
authorities such as the WHO and NIH Pubmed. Metadata and content comes from the
existing open <a href="https://fatcat.wiki">fatcat</a> catalog of research
outputs.
See <a href="{{ url_for("search.page_sources") }}">"Sources"</a> for details.

<p>
It is hoped that with additional care and development this resource may be
useful to anybody keeping up with research in this area, and particularly folks
working on systemic reviews, bibliometrics, or metaresearch. However, at time
of writing, this is at best a technology demonstration, not a robust piece of
knowledge infrastructure.

<p>
We encourage folks to consider the following more authoriative and
well-supported tools for research discovery:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://pubmed.gov">Pubmed</a> for biomedical research in
  general, and the subject-specific <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/">LitCovid</a>
  index for COVID-19.
  <li><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a>
  <li><a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>
</ul>

<h2>Service Disclaimers</h2>

<p>
This is not a production-supported service of the Internet Archive. The website
and search API may become unavailable due to resource load, operator
availability, etc. If you would like to depend on this service, please contact
us.

<p>
Some content available in this index may not be "perpetually accessible" after
the COVID-19 crises ends, due to temporary content licenses. The service itself
(covid19.fatcat.wiki) may also not be operated after the crisis, though all of
the source code and upstream metadata should be "perpetually accessible".

<h2>Additional Resources</h2>

<p>
Source code is available on Github, and bugs can be reported there as issues:
