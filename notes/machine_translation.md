Overall concept is to use machine translation to fill gaps or provide a
starting point for human translation. Quality would obviously be best from

Ideas:
- translate GROBID XML or JSON output offline
- call a platform/API to translate individual papers
- can directly link to google translate (or other platform) of the paper
