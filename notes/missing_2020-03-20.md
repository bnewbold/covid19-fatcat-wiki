Summary:
- some informal material mixed in (commentary/opinion/video)
- bunch of chinese papers, often with DOI, not indexed in western databases,
  but are in MAG. MAG identifiers mostly not included. could get metadata from
  wanfang data (company)?
- some stub articles: eg, indexes
- some exact title matches, missing identifier (pubmed_id, DOI) matches

Many of these "no such DOI" may be partially registered?

Top journals (actually books?) with missing DOIs:

    bnewbold@orithena$ cat missing.json | jq .who_paper -c | jq 'select(.doi != "" and .pubmed_id =="" and .pmcid == "")' -c | jq 'select(.title != "")' -c |  jq .journal | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
         28 "Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases"
         13 "Principles and Practice of Pediatric Infectious Diseases"
         11 "Infectious Diseases"
          9 "Hunter's Tropical Medicine and Emerging Infectious Diseases"

          4 "Clinical Immunology"
          3 "Zakim and Boyer's Hepatology"
          [...]

## PMID/PMCID

    jq 'select(.doi == "" and .pubmed_id !="")' -c
    => 8

    jq 'select(.doi == "" and .pmcid !="")' -c
    => 223

All of these PMIDs and PMCIDs seem to be valid. From a quick scan, they seem to
not be in fatcat because there are already works there with DOIs.

## Recommendations

In your data munging, filter out:

- works with blank titles and no external identifier (eg, no DOI, PMCID, PMID, MAG ID)
- works with blocklist titles (see below). I assume these got included due to
  fulltext search matches, but I think are just noise
- works with titles which are a single capital letter (eg, "S", "C")

Title blocklist (preceeded by count); usually I do these by lower-casing and
striping non-alphanumeric characters before comparing:

There is some chinese journal registry number, eg "ISSN 1005-1201 CN 11-2149/R"
